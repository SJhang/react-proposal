# myAccount Demo Proposal

## Single Page Application for myAccount.

- React Router Dom library enables us to go to other pages(components) depending on the route.

- This is different from html <a> tag and href because they cause the page to refresh.

- Redux implementation might be needed. In case of the myStore and findStore component. If not, need to pass a callback from the parent.

- Instead of trying to make so many reusable components, have some atomic components such as HdTextField, HdCheckbox, HdButton, etc.


#### This is a very simple layout.

######- Couldn't test the code out because of proxy set up and porting for the Checkout Project.
